## :package: Installation

### First check if you have NPM installed

Before installing this Readme Generator you need to check if you have `Node.js`and `NPM` installed on your computer.

To check if you have `Node.js` installed, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#then-install-the-readme-generator).

```sh
v10.14.1
```

To confirm that you have `NPM` installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```sh
npm -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#then-install-the-readme-generator).

```sh
6.4.1
```

If `Node.js` or `NPM` is not installed you can install them on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Don't forget to update `NPM` after installing `Node.js`:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Then install the Readme Generator

```sh
npm install --global readme-boilerplate
```
